Week 5 Submissions:

1. Healpix.py
-Requirements: numpy, healpy (Python implementation of HEALPix)
-Generates a bunch of points on the celestial sphere, and distributes them across a given HEALPix projection
-Also plots up all data points on an all-sky projection, and shows specific HEALPix pixels in various colors
-Determines which HEALPix pixels at Nside=2 are contained within pixel 5 of Nside=1 projection
-Then I got curious about how quickly the distribution of points across HEALPix pixels converges to a truly
    uniform distribution. I'd planned to code this up but decided against it cause I was feeling like crap. I'd
    like to come back to this though to basically test/quantify the Central Limit Theorem

2. Spherical_Caps.py
-Requirements: astropy, numpy
-Determines the 4-vector associated with a couple given spherical caps of given RA, dec, and radius
-Prints out the vectors with a given formatting (presumably to be used in a future assignment)
