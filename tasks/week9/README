Week 9 Submissions:

1. magnitude_systems.py
-Calculates ugriz magnitudes for a given Landolt standard star, based on
   UBVRI colors/magnitudes
-Finds matching source in the Legacy Survey sweeps files
-Converts Legacy Survey flux in maggies to appropriate magnitude

2. classification.py
-Read in data for positions of spectroscopically confirmed stars and qsos
-Match positions for each type of object with SDSS Sweep Files
-Convert flux for each object to dust-corrected magnitudes
-Plot on color-color diagrams
-Determine if we can distinguish between objects using a color cut
-Saves plots with color cut to png files

NOTES:
-must have access to /d/scratch directory in order to download
   relevant sweeps and data files
